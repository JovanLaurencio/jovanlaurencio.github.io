					<p>Many people enjoy the nightlife.  But often, the unenjoyable parts are waiting in line at the bar or splitting the tab—highly inefficient processes that often include being elbowed,  getting doused with a spilled drink, being ignored by the bartender, or waiting while staff locates your misplaced payment.</p>
					<p>Waitless is a mobile app development company based in Los Angeles, CA, led by a team bent on shaking up the pay-at-table and bar-tab app categories. The company’s latest idea is a mobile and watch app for patrons visiting bars and venues that garner large crowds and long lines. The solution removes the user from the lines, gives them more control over order and payment, and ultimately makes the occasion more fun and enjoyable.</p>

					<p>Users also wanted better explanation and flexibility in how they could split bills with friends in a group. Splitting a bill was a primary feature of competitor apps, but the process confused the user or the app didn’t offer an option to split the bill by line item.</p>

					<p>In addition to user research, I create a competitor analysis ( <a href="https://app.xtensio.com/folio/1zbkkcgg" target="_blank">Link</a> ) of the following apps: Tabbed Out, Velocity, and Orderella. Tabbed Out highlighted user incentives, but the UI was inconsistent and lacked engagement. Orderella suffered from these same inconsistencies. However, it utilized an onboarding experience to explain its key features increasing engagement and confidence of a potential user. Velocity had the most appealing and delightful design. But it also had the most feature bloat of the three competitors and limited itself to four- and five-star venues that were “hard-to-reserve.”</p>

					<h2>Wireframes &amp; User Testing</h2>
					<p>I designed my closeout process to be short and sweet. Users had the option to pay the bill or split it two different ways. They could add profiles of others who also used the app or claim unassigned drinks to their portion of the tab. I conducted a user test on my lo-fi wireframes and received invaluable feedback in areas of the process that I had blindly overlooked.</p>
					<p>Users, particularly those with Android devices, disliked my current labeling system for unassigned friends informing how that system was typically reserved for message notifications. My solution was to remove this system and replace the avatar placeholder icon with one that was more semantic. </p>

					<p>Users also highlighted redundancies within the split process. My initial screens repeated the tab review.

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This project taught me to:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><b>Build a list of terms and determine usage.</b> I’m getting better at copywriting with every project, but in this project, I was confusing users by using several forms of ‘bill’ and ‘friends’ freely throughout the app. These terms should be defined earlier in a project to reduce confusion in later stages and in testing.</li>
						<li><b>Save some suggestions for future releases.</b> Users will always have ideas for additional features. At times, I found myself exploring ways to incorporate these nice-to-have features and losing sight of the project goals. If it weren’t for these goals, I could’ve easily been designing forever. Instead, I learned that it’s better to keep the product lightweight, get something out there, and work these nice-to-have features into a future release.</li>
						<li><b>Treat the users as the experts.</b>  During tests, users brought up some interesting scenarios I hadn’t yet thought of (ex. What happens if I want to create additional orders before I’ve received my first order?). I didn’t have an answer. So I asked the user what they thought would happen and they provided an amazing solution. “Two orders max at any time.”</li>
						<li><b>Request feedback for future development.</b>  I was thinking of the nice-to-have features and wondered if I might be missing other ‘essential’ features that could be first added into future designs. I learned that the best apps don’t leave this to chance and will add a screen to the end of transactions to ask for feedback. By doing this, the brand is better prepared to continue prioritizing feature lists to give users what they want, when they want.</li>
