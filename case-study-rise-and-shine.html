					<h2>User Research</h2>
					<p>In order to gather insight about the target market, I created a survey in Google Forms to take advantage of the conditional logic feature and posted my it to the coffee ( <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/" target="_blank">Link</a> ) and Cold Brew subreddits ( <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/coldbrew/" target="_blank">Link</a> ). I also sat in various third-wave coffee shops around the Condesa and Roma neighborhoods and made conversation with neighbors seated next to me, particularly those I noticed ordering a Cold Brew.</p>
					<p>I wanted to learn potential customers’:</p>
					<ul class="content-list">
						<li>Coffee-drinking habits</li>
						<li>Online-purchasing habits of coffee drinkers</li>
						<li>Needs for a subscription delivery service</li>

				<div class="offset-by-one ten columns">
					<p>From the surveys, I learned that more than half the respondents had tried and enjoyed Cold Brew coffee. Respondents purchased their coffee online because it saved them time and money and helped them jump-start their morning routine.</p>
					<p>Shoppers who purchased coffee products online expressed a need for a quick way to reorder their most recent/ favorite product(s). Users also felt that more in-depth product descriptions could help them make better purchasing decisions. The majority of shoppers shied away from purchasing coffee from mobile devices. When asked about this, responses centered around complex and confusing order and checkout processes.</p>
					<p>Due mainly to the lack of education on the benefits of Cold Brew over a normal cup of drip coffee, most survey respondents were averse to ordering Cold Brew coffee online. In my interviews, I shared the benefits of Cold Brew coffee (i.e. long shelf life, lower acidity) and observed that 80% expressed a heightened curiosity and interest in trying out this subscription delivery service.</p>
					<p>What I found most surprising was that Cold Brew coffee was enjoyed by a wide range of coffee drinkers and, more surprisingly, by an older demographic . My initial thoughts were that Cold Brew was a trendier way of drinking coffee and that an older demographic would rather stick to their main drink. But coffee drinkers were keen on trying most coffee products at least once, particularly as those products came closer to the natural flavors of the coffee bean.</p>
					<p>Based on my survey data and user interviews, I created two personas: The Newbie (visitors/ potential users) and The Loyalist (returning users). Based on one particular interview with an industry professional, I created a business admin persona. But this deviated from the focus of creating a front-facing website for customers and I eventually used this persona to help tell the brand story.</p>

					<p>These competitors competed with the Rise &amp; Shine in the retail sector, but they would almost certainly lose their advantage online and in the e-commerce sector. Rise &amp; Shine's competitors weren’t recognizing the mobile audience. Websites existed merely as a marketing page. These sites were unresponsive, forms weren’t optimized for mobile accessibility, and content/ blogs were outdated. The checkout experience, if it existed at all, was confusing to fill out. And most directed users towards connecting with their brand through social media.</p>
					<p>Two of three competitors mentioned on their sites that they sold Cold Brew coffee. However, there was little attention put towards marketing their Cold Brew coffee, their Cold Brew subscription service, and they fell short of effectively highlighting any products they offered as a signature or specialty of their brand.</p>
					<p>I saw a huge opportunity to quickly and effectively grow a loyal following, build capital through online sales, and gain ground in the coffee race.</p>
					<p>After organizing the data, I concluded that Rise &amp; Shine’s online subscription service would need to be responsive in its design, highly informative of the product(s) it is offering, and simplistic in its order/ checkout processes.</p>
					<p>The following features would be implemented into the product:</p>
					<ul class="content-list">
						<li>Account creation</li>
						<li>Delivery Service Validation (by neighborhood, zip code, etc)</li>
						<li>Subscription Management</li>
						<li>Simplified order and payment forms for increased conversion</li>
						<li>Personalized delivery service - Product, Time, Location</li>

					<p>I focused on moving new users to the product page of the site. Following service validation, new users were split into two groups: 1. users who lived within the service area and 2. users who lived outside the service area. Users within the service area validated and moved swiftly to the product catalog page to begin the order process. Users outside the service area were treated like the former but with additional options to contact and connect with the brand. By continuing the flow for this user, I could increase user engagement and generate a lead for the brand.</p>

					<p>To outline the user flow of the signup process, I referenced the design solution of Stumptown Roasters,  an indirect competitor based out of Portland and distributing their products throughout the US. This company designed for engagement by allowing users to first create their order. Upon submission, the user is prompted to log in/ sign up to continue their order. This is a great conversion strategy because the user has already decided to invest in the product.</p>

					<p>Simultaneously, I began designing the brand identity and visual design systems.</p>
					<p>The logo incorporates two fonts juxtaposed in balance and harmony.  The words <i>‘Rise’</i> and <i>‘Shine’</i> are represented with a rugged and handwritten decoration, similar to many of the storefront signs of Mexican tiendas. The <i>‘&amp;’</i> and <i>‘Coldbrew Coffee’</i> are sharp and clean, models of a modern, exemplary brand. The logo is held together by the sunshine rising from the right corner of the type, its undulated edges referencing the stain left behind by the bottom of a coffee mug.</p>

					<h2>Wireframes</h2>
					<p>I needed to accommodate for mobile users in the design and decided for a mobile-first design approach.

					<p>To help the user navigate the site, I grouped content into sections with bold headers and comfortable spacing. I told the brand story through an image slider.

					<p>I also focused on the visualization of the service validation flow of new users.

					<p>Another area I focused on was the member account/ subscriptions page. From a business standpoint, satisfied customers would set up additional subscriptions for family/ friends. So rather than approaching this page as an area to manage-cancel subscriptions, it would be designed to manage-add subscriptions. Initially, I added an ‘add subscription’ call-to-action button above the subscriptions. But viewed from a mobile device, multiple subscriptions would force the user to scroll this CTA from the screen. Rather than reducing the screen space with a sticky CTA, I added an additional CTA button below the full list of subscriptions to subtly reinforce this action.</p>

					<p>One challenge to the checkout process was reducing hesitance. I designed the checkout page with a sectioned form so the user could review their order and input payment details on one screen, reducing frustration that comes from navigating multiple forms and pages.

					<p>In my first round of testing, multiple users raised concerns regarding the details of the free trial agreement. Users didn't understand the how the free trial worked because my first designs did not include this information. I had relied on an assumption that the user would enjoy the appearance of the free sample added to their order on the checkout page. I saw this as an issue of transparency and prioritized getting these details on the product catalog page for the next iteration, to be read and understood by the user before they began creating their order. Adding this disclaimer at the beginning of the product catalog page built up user confidence to work through the order funnel.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This project taught me to:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><b>Understand the product, then write the copy.</b> Writing copy became easier after speaking with the industry professional about his own business. I treated our phone call as an interview with a key stakeholder and asked all the questions necessary to get an understanding of the industry, his business, and the products he sold. His words and insight were used to create a persona that later helped me create a better brand experience.</li>
						<li><b>Utilize preference tests.</b> These short tests helped me decide which actionable phrases to add to my call-to-action buttons, phrases that could ultimately lead to higher conversion rates.</li>
						<li><b>Provide clear hierarchy of content in lo-fi wireframes.</b> I discovered users had a difficult time distinguishing a headline from body copy and a button from a link. I recognized this could pose an issue on larger teams where the person that created the wireframes is not the person explaining those same wireframes to others involved on the project.</li>
						<li><b>Reduce confusion for the user, then help them make a decision.</b> Removing redundancies within a product’s design makes it easier for users to understand the interface… or the form they’re requested to fill out. But I learned that the design could be made even more intuitive by helping users make decisions. Helping, and influencing, user decisions could be as simple as 1. highlighting the popular item within the product group to help lead the user to signup up or 2. pre-selecting form fields to expedite form completion.</li>

					<p>Moving forward, I’m already thinking of how to present extended delivery coverage. With more neighborhoods serviced, the list could grow cumbersome and TL;DR. I’m also considering the IA arrangement of new or seasonal products on the landing and product catalog page. Lastly, I would put more attention on The Partner, a business/ shop owner who’d receive benefits from the brand for referring customers. Taking another step back, this project could also dive deeper into the user interface of The Admin,  the third persona created for personal reference. There are many parts to this passion project, but it goes nowhere without first solving the problems for the primary users.</p>
